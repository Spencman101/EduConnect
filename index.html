            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to develop an AI platform that enables students to input their academic and personal learning preferences, 
                and then be automatically matched with a tutor who fits those needs. 
                This platform aims to match compatible tutors with students based on their learning styles in order to achieve higher educational goals. 
                This platform is designed to make finding a tutor easy and efficient.
